### Phase 1: Setup & Core Backend Logic

**Objective:** Establish the monorepo structure and implement the core backend functionalities for RPC communication, rate limiting, and metrics calculation.

1.  **Monorepo Initialization:**
    *   [V] Initialize `npm` project at the root (`lava-rpc-monitor`) (Status: Done).
    *   [V] Configure NPM workspaces in the root `package.json` to include `packages/backend` and `packages/frontend` (Status: Done).
    *   [V] Create the `packages/backend` directory (Status: Done).
    *   [V] Initialize a `package.json` for the backend (`@lava-rpc-monitor/backend`). Include basic scripts (e.g., `start`, `build`, `test`) (Status: Done).
    *   [V] Create the `packages/frontend` directory (Status: Done).
    *   [V] Initialize a `package.json` for the frontend (`@lava-rpc-monitor/frontend`) (Status: Done).
    *   [V] Create initial `README.md` files for root, `packages/backend`, and `packages/frontend` (Status: Done).
2.  **Backend - RPC Client & Rate Limiting:**
    *   [V] **Directory Structure:** Create `src/services/` and `src/utils/` within `packages/backend/src/` (Status: Done).
    *   [V] **Domain (Core Logic):** Define TypeScript interfaces/types for JSON-RPC request/response structures and the metrics data to be collected (e.g., in `packages/backend/src/types.ts` or similar) (Status: Done).
    *   [V] **Infrastructure (RPC Service):** Implement an `rpcService.ts` in `packages/backend/src/services/` (Status: Done).
        *   [V] Use `axios` (or `node-fetch`) to send JSON-RPC requests.
        *   [V] Target RPC: `https://eth1.lava.build`.
        *   [V] Implement functions for initial methods: `eth_blockNumber`, `eth_chainId`.
        *   [V] Handle successful responses and errors gracefully.
    *   [V] **Application (Rate Limiter):** Implement `rateLimiter.ts` in `packages/backend/src/utils/` (Status: Done).
        *   [V] Ensure no more than 300 requests are made per 10-second window.
        *   [V] This utility should be callable before making an RPC request.
    *   [V] **Integration:** Integrate the `rateLimiter` into the `rpcService` to control request frequency (Status: Done).

        *   Polling mechanism.
        *   Track response time, success/failure.
        *   Calculate aggregate metrics.
        *   Store basic error messages.
    *   [V] **Testing (Jest):** Write unit tests for `metricsService.ts` (Status: Skipped - Needs revisit).
4.  **Backend - WebSocket Server:**
    *   [V] **Infrastructure (WebSocket Service):** Create `websocketService.ts` in `packages/backend/src/services/` (Status: Done).

        *   Initialize and start all services.
    *   [ ] **Testing (Jest):** Write unit tests for `websocketService.ts` (Status: Skipped - Needs revisit).

### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation

**Objective:** Develop the React/TypeScript frontend to connect to the backend via WebSockets and display the monitoring data in real-time.

1.  **Frontend - Project Setup (React + TypeScript):**
    *   [ ] Initialize React project (Status: Pending).
    *   [ ] Clean up boilerplate (Status: Pending).
    *   [ ] Set up directory structure (Status: Pending).
2.  **Frontend - WebSocket Client:**
    *   [ ] **Infrastructure (WebSocket Client Service):** Implement `websocketClient.ts` (Status: Pending).
        *   Connect to backend WebSocket.
        *   Handle events, parse messages.
    *   [ ] **State Integration:** Provide data to React components (Status: Pending).
3.  **Frontend - UI Components & Display:**
    *   [ ] **Presentation (Core Components):** Create components (`BlockNumberDisplay`, `ChainIdDisplay`, etc.) (Status: Pending).
    *   [ ] **State Management:** Manage metrics data (Status: Pending).
    *   [ ] **Presentation (App Layout - `App.tsx`):** Structure main app (Status: Pending).
    *   [ ] **Styling:** Basic CSS/SCSS (Status: Pending).
    *   [ ] **Testing (Jest & React Testing Library):** Write component tests (Status: Pending).

### Frontend (`packages/frontend`)

*   **Status**: In Progress
*   **Features Working**:
    *   Basic application structure setup (Vite + React + TS).
    *   Components for displaying metrics (BlockNumber, ChainId, SuccessRate, AvgResponseTime, Errors, Status).
    *   Hook (`useRpcMetrics`) to fetch data (likely needs connection to backend).
    *   Initial grid layout.
*   **Features Implemented/Improved (Current Task)**:
    *   Refactored styling to use global CSS (`index.css`) instead of inline styles.
    *   Implemented a high-contrast dark theme to fix readability issues.
    *   Centralized layout (`.grid-container`) and card (`.card`) styles.
    *   Fixed error message handling:
        *   Corrected `RpcMetrics.errorMessages` type in `websocketClient.ts` to `string[]`.
        *   Updated `App.tsx` to use `metrics.errorMessages` directly.
*   **Remaining Tasks**:
    *   **Verification**: Visually confirm the new styles render correctly and improve UX, and that errors display correctly.
    *   **Component Styling**: Check/refine styles within individual components if needed.
    *   **Data Integration**: Ensure components correctly display data fetched by `useRpcMetrics` (pending backend connection/data source).
    *   **Error Handling**: Enhance display/handling of errors from the RPC endpoint.
    *   **Status Indicator Logic**: Implement detailed logic for the overall status indicator.
    *   **Responsiveness**: Test and refine responsiveness across different screen sizes.
    *   **User Feedback**: Incorporate user feedback on the new design.

    *   [ ] Define `backend` and `frontend` services.
    *   [ ] Define networks (optional) (Status: Pending).
    *   [ ] Define volumes (optional) (Status: Pending).

## Progress

### What Works

-   According to the user, the entire monitoring tool (backend and frontend) is functionally complete and "runs as expected."
-   This implies:
    -   JSON-RPC requests are being sent to `https://eth1.lava.build`.
    -   Metrics (request success rate, response time, errors) are being tracked.
    -   Results are displayed in real-time on a user interface.
    -   Rate limiting (300 requests per 10 seconds) is implemented and functional.
    -   The application is containerized with Docker and presumably runs correctly via Docker Compose.

### What's Left to Build/Do

-   **Code Understanding**: The immediate task is for the user to gain a clear understanding of all parts of the existing codebase.
-   **Code Cleanup/Refactoring**: Based on the understanding gained, identify and remove any unnecessary code, components, or dependencies.
-   **Documentation Review**: Ensure the existing documentation (setup, run instructions, test interpretation) is clear and accurate, especially in light of any code removals.

### Progress Status

-   **Development Phase**: Functionally Complete.
-   **Current Phase**: Code Review, Refinement, and Understanding.
-   **Overall**: The project is in a late stage, focusing on polish and ensuring the candidate can fully explain the delivered solution.
