### Frontend (`packages/frontend`)

*   **Status**: In Progress
*   **Features Working**:
    *   Basic application structure setup (Vite + React + TS).
    *   Components for displaying metrics (BlockNumber, ChainId, SuccessRate, AvgResponseTime, Errors, Status).
    *   Hook (`useRpcMetrics`) to fetch data (likely needs connection to backend).
    *   Initial grid layout.
*   **Features Implemented/Improved (Current Task)**:
    *   Refactored styling to use global CSS (`index.css`) instead of inline styles.
    *   Implemented a high-contrast dark theme to fix readability issues.
    *   Centralized layout (`.grid-container`) and card (`.card`) styles.
*   **Remaining Tasks**:
    *   **Verification**: Visually confirm the new styles render correctly and improve UX.
    *   **Component Styling**: Check/refine styles within individual components if needed.
    *   **Data Integration**: Ensure components correctly display data fetched by `useRpcMetrics` (pending backend connection/data source).
    *   **Error Handling**: Enhance display/handling of errors from the RPC endpoint.
    *   **Status Indicator Logic**: Implement detailed logic for the overall status indicator.

## What Works

Based on initial analysis of the `@lava-rpc-monitor/backend` package:

*   **Core Service Structure**: Services for RPC communication (`rpcService.ts`), metrics calculation (`metricsService.ts`), and WebSocket broadcasting (`websocketService.ts`) are established.
*   **RPC Polling Logic**: Functionality to query the Lava RPC endpoint (`https://eth1.lava.build`) appears to be implemented within `rpcService.ts`.
*   **Rate Limiting**: A rate limiter mechanism is in place and has unit tests (`rateLimiter.test.ts`), suggesting it's a functional component.
*   **Metrics Service**: `metricsService.ts` is present, indicating that logic for transforming RPC responses into monitorable metrics is likely implemented or sketched out.
*   **WebSocket Service**: `websocketService.ts` exists, suggesting the capability to send data (presumably metrics) to connected clients.
*   **TypeScript Compilation**: The project is set up to compile TypeScript to JavaScript (`npm run build`).
*   **Basic Testing**: Unit tests are present for `rpcService.ts` and `rateLimiter.ts`.
*   **Entry Point**: `src/index.ts` serves as the application's entry point, likely initializing and starting the services.

## What's Left to Build / Verify

*   **Express.js Integration (if needed)**: The `README.md` mentions Express.js as a possibility for routing. It's unclear if this has been implemented or if current needs are met by WebSockets alone.
*   **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Tests for `metricsService.ts` and `websocketService.ts` are not apparent and should be added to ensure reliability.
*   **End-to-End Testing**: No clear indication of end-to-end tests that verify the flow from RPC polling through metrics calculation to WebSocket broadcast.
*   **Detailed README**: The "Getting Started" and "Running Tests" sections in `README.md` need to be completed.
*   **Configuration Management**: How configurations (e.g., RPC endpoint URL, polling intervals, rate limit parameters) are managed is not immediately clear.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Logging**: While services exist, a detailed review is needed to assess the comprehensiveness of error handling and logging across the application.
*   **Deployment Strategy**: No information on how the backend service is intended to be deployed or managed in a production environment.
*   **Frontend Integration Points**: While the WebSocket service is for clients, detailed contracts or examples for frontend integration might be beneficial.

## Progress Status

*   **Foundation Laid**: The core backend services and structure are in place.
*   **Key Features Partially Implemented**: RPC polling, rate limiting, and basic WebSocket communication seem functional at a component level.
*   **Testing Needs Expansion**: Current tests cover some critical parts, but more comprehensive coverage is needed.
*   **Documentation Needs Completion**: The `README.md` requires more detail.
*   **Operational Aspects Undefined**: Deployment, configuration, and advanced monitoring/logging strategies are not yet detailed.

**What works (as of initial planning):**
-   N/A - Project is currently in the planning phase. No code has been implemented yet.

**What's left to build (High-Level):**

    *   Calculate metrics (success rate, response time, error counts).
    *   Set up WebSocket server (e.g., using `ws` or `socket.io`) to broadcast metrics.
    *   Unit tests (Jest).
3.  **Frontend Development (`packages/frontend`):**
    *   Set up React with TypeScript project.
    *   Implement WebSocket client to connect to the backend.
    *   Create UI components to display real-time metrics.

    *   Create `Dockerfile` for the frontend (multi-stage build for serving static assets).
    *   Create `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate backend and frontend services.
5.  **Documentation:**
    *   `README.md` files for each package and root.
    *   Detailed setup and run instructions.
    *   Instructions for interpreting test results.
6.  **Testing & Iteration:**
