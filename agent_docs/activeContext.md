# Active Context: Lava RPC Monitor Backend

## What You're Working On Now

Currently, the task is to understand the existing state of the `@lava-rpc-monitor/backend` package. This involves analyzing its file structure, dependencies, and implemented functionalities to provide a summary of achievements.

## Recent Changes

This is the initial analysis phase. No code changes have been made to the backend package itself yet. The primary activity has been file examination and documentation (Memory Bank creation).

## Next Steps

1.  Complete the initial assessment of the `@backend` package.
2.  Populate the remaining Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) with information gathered about the backend.
3.  Await further instructions from the user regarding development tasks for the backend.

## Current Focus: Frontend UI/UX Enhancement

Improving the user interface and experience for the Lava RPC Monitor frontend application (`lava-rpc-monitor/packages/frontend`).

## Recent Changes (UI Enhancement Task):

*   Identified low contrast issues in the existing dark theme.
*   Refactored styling:
    *   Moved inline styles (`gridStyle`, `cardStyle`) from `App.tsx` to `index.css`.
    *   Applied CSS classes (`.grid-container`, `.card`, `.error-log`) in `App.tsx`.
*   Updated `index.css`:
    *   Defined an explicit dark theme with improved color contrast (darker background, lighter card background, much lighter text color in cards).
    *   Adjusted link colors for better visibility.
    *   Refined global styles (body padding, heading size/color).
    *   Added styles for card titles and loading text.
    *   Removed unused button styles and light theme query for simplification.

## Next Steps:

*   Verify the visual appearance and functionality of the frontend application after the style changes.
*   Potentially refine styles within individual components (`src/components/`) if necessary.
*   Await user feedback/approval on the UI changes.
