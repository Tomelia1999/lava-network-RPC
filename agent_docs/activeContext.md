# Active Context: Lava RPC Monitor Backend

## Active Context

### What We're Working On Now

The current focus is on understanding the existing codebase of the Lava Network RPC monitoring tool. The user intends to ask questions about specific code sections to clarify their purpose. Based on these explanations, the user may want to remove unnecessary code or components.

### Recent Changes

The project is reported to be fully functional and "runs as expected."

### Next Steps

1.  The user will provide snippets or paths to code they want to understand.
2.  I will explain the purpose of the specified code.
3.  If the code appears unnecessary for the project's core requirements (as defined in `productContext.md` and `instructions.text`), I will suggest its removal.
4.  The user will decide whether to act on the suggestions.

## Current Focus: Frontend UI/UX Enhancement

Improving the user interface and experience for the Lava RPC Monitor frontend application (`lava-rpc-monitor/packages/frontend`).

## Recent Changes (UI Enhancement Task):

*   Identified low contrast issues in the existing dark theme.
*   Refactored styling:
    *   Moved inline styles (`gridStyle`, `cardStyle`) from `App.tsx` to `index.css`.
    *   Applied CSS classes (`.grid-container`, `.card`, `.error-log`) in `App.tsx`.
*   Updated `index.css`:
    *   Defined an explicit dark theme with improved color contrast (darker background, lighter card background, much lighter text color in cards).
    *   Adjusted link colors for better visibility.
    *   Refined global styles (body padding, heading size/color).
    *   Added styles for card titles and loading text.
    *   Removed unused button styles and light theme query for simplification.
*   **Fixed error message handling in `App.tsx`**:
    *   Updated `RpcMetrics` interface in `lava-rpc-monitor/packages/frontend/src/services/websocketClient.ts` to correctly define `errorMessages` as `string[]` (was `{ timestamp: string; message: string }[]`), aligning with backend data.
    *   Modified `App.tsx` to use `metrics.errorMessages` directly for `plainErrorMessages`, removing the incorrect `.map(e => e.message)` transformation.

## Next Steps:

*   Verify the visual appearance and functionality of the frontend application after the style changes and error handling fix.
*   Potentially refine styles within individual components (`src/components/`) if necessary.
*   Await user feedback/approval on the UI changes and error handling fix.
