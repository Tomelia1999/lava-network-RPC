Blockchain Engineer Challenge

The candidate is required to build a monitoring tool that sends requests to the
public Lava Network RPC endpoint at https://eth1.lava.build using JSON-RPC. The tool
should monitor the health of the RPC node, track metrics such as request success
rate, response time, and errors, and display the results in real-time on a user
interface. The rate limit is 300 requests per 10 seconds.
The tool should be containerized using Docker for easy deployment and
scalability.
Technologies:
Backend: Node.js with axios or node-fetch for JSON-RPC requests
Frontend: Any JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue)
Containerization: Docker and Docker Compose
Rate Limiting: Implement throttling to ensure no more than 300 requests per
10 seconds
Testing: Any unit testing library
